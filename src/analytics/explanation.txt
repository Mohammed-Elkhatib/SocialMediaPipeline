Let me break down what each file in the proposed analytics module would do:

### Core Files:

**1. analytics/service.py**
- Acts as the main entry point for all analytics operations
- Coordinates between processors and exporters
- Provides high-level methods like `run_word_frequency_analysis()` or `run_engagement_analysis()`
- Handles exceptions and ensures data flows correctly from processors to exporters

**2. analytics/scheduler.py**
- Manages when analytics processes should run
- Could implement time-based scheduling (hourly, daily)
- Could also support event-based triggers (e.g., run analysis when data volume reaches a threshold)
- Handles locking to prevent concurrent analysis runs

### Processors:

**3. analytics/processors/word_frequency.py**
- Contains the `WordFrequencyProcessor` class
- Fetches tweet data from the database via TweetModel
- Extracts and counts keywords from tweet content
- Identifies trending terms and their frequency
- Performs analysis operations like finding trending terms over time
- Returns processed data structures, not raw database records

**4. analytics/processors/engagement.py**
- Contains the `EngagementProcessor` class
- Analyzes likes, comments, retweets patterns
- Identifies top performing content
- Calculates engagement rates and trends
- May segment engagement by time periods (daily, weekly)
- Returns processed metrics rather than raw data

### Exporters:

**5. analytics/exporters/json_exporter.py**
- Takes processed data from processors
- Formats it specifically for dashboard consumption
- Handles file operations (saving to disk with proper paths)
- May include data transformations specific to visualization needs
- Ensures consistent JSON structure

**6. analytics/exporters/db_exporter.py**
- Takes processed data from processors
- Maps it to database schema for storage
- Calls appropriate TweetModel methods to save results
- Handles batching for performance
- Manages update vs. insert logic

### Dashboard Integration:

**7. dashboard/data_providers.py**
- Fetches pre-processed analytics from database or JSON files
- May perform light transformations for specific visualizations
- Provides consistent interfaces for dashboard components
- Handles caching to improve dashboard performance

**8. dashboard/api.py**
- Exposes REST endpoints for the dashboard frontend
- May trigger on-demand analytics if needed
- Returns data in formats ready for visualization libraries
- Manages authentication/authorization for dashboard access

This modular approach allows each component to have a specific responsibility while working together to provide analyzed data to your dashboard. The processors focus on the analysis logic, exporters handle output formatting, and the service coordinates the overall flow.
